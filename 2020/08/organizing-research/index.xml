  <div class="PREVIEW">
    <p>
      Small tangent into the basic, how to organize research papers and related
      artifacts.  I have a few ideas for how to best handle this, but nothing
      concrete I can point to that I'm satisfied with.
    </p>

    <p>
      Is this a useless divergence into tool sharpening and small optimizations for
      little gain?  Or is this a worthwhile venture to get right early on that pays
      off in the long term?
    </p>

  <p>
    As I'm starting to dive into the "literature", as it might occasionally be
    referred to, there is a certain amassing of papers to read.  Worse, there tends
    to be a mixed bag of advice for handling the fire hose of information and how
    to not drown in the deluge of papers that tends to accompany research.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are certainly a myriad of different approaches to solving this problem.
    I have been debating a few approaches and would like to describe them and,
    ideally, exposit my way towards a final solution.
