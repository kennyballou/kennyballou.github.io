      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAg4yMangmY">"Yesterday, you said tomorrow."</a>  Entering the first week of being a full-time
      graduate assistant, I want to start a more earnest attempt to share more of the
      experience and the journey.  I've always maintained that the journey itself is
      the worthier part, the ends only a different way to spell "beginning".

    Any time I internally commit to doing something, I remember the mildly
    ridiculous quote from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAg4yMangmY">Shia LaBeouf's GreenScreen recording</a> "Yesterday, you said
    tomorrow".  Yesterday, I said tomorrow I would write this post.  Today is now
    tomorrow and here goes.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am starting my transition from a full-time software developer/site
    reliability engineer to being a full-time graduate assistant, working towards a
    PhD.  This post is a first in a series of posts where I will attempt to share
    my research; technical tangents that come along the way; my thoughts and
    inspirations; and likely many other random topics in between.  It's my
    intention to write and share these fairly regularly.  Of course, we'll see how
    the energy maintains through the weeks.
