<p>
Another brief digression into organizing source code and projects.  Described
here is my current ideal, subject to change, that has evolved over the years of
being a student, a professional, a contractor, and now a student again.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge80d892" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge80d892"><a id="ID-f9211020-9523-43cd-8bf7-86c1b52e9758"></a>Why this Discussion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge80d892">
<p>
<a href="https://kennyballou.com/blog/2020/08/organizing-research">Previously</a>, we discussed how to organize research papers and related metadata.
Today, I want to discuss how <i>I</i> personally organize my source code.  I write
this because I am occasionally asked about this; but even more personally, I
wish more of these "boring" blog posts were available and easily accessible
from others so that I could learn what/how others are going about this to see
if there is anything I could learn or leverage in my own setup.  My first step
to correcting this is to add my own notes on how and why I organize my
"workspace" the way I do/have.
</p>

<p>
Many developers and many languages will discuss how to structure an individual
project, or what the best practice are around a specific language or
technology.  However, I have found very, very few discuss the overall structure
of many projects, or more pointedly, or to organize <span class="underline">all</span> the different source
trees.  This discussion may implicitly exist in mono-repository vs
poly-repository discussions, but repository organization is still too limiting
to my overall goal of discussing how to organize <span class="underline">every</span> project, regardless of
ecosystem or project set.  That is, we set out to answer "how do you organize
all the different projects and ecosystems you're working on or dependent on?"
</p>

<p>
Perhaps it's important to note that not all projects in a workspace are active
projects but may be dependencies that needed to be adjusted to work with the
current active project set.
</p>

<p>
I will introduce and discuss the highlights of the development of my
organization and how I arrived or was influenced in a particular direction or
another.  Finally, I will discuss the current organization method.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc5bd274">
<p>
The madness of my organization is derivable through a series of tools and
stages in my development career.  Certainly, there is some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_revisionism">revisionism</a> here,
nothing is ever as clean as we may make it.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4ab6ea9" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org4ab6ea9"><a id="ID-d9a9b147-89ee-4267-94ba-c7e88d4c6194"></a>Before University</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4ab6ea9">
<p>
When learning some programming in high-school, there was <b>NO</b> organization.
Projects were loosely collected under whatever folder made sense in the moment,
projects captured by "solutions" in <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/">Visual Studio</a>.
</p>

<p>
When I started my first internship, code was collectively organized under
<code>C:\\dev\</code>.  This was in the initial developer checklists for configuring a new
machine: something along the lines of "checkout the <a href="https://www.nongnu.org/cvs/">CVS</a> tree to <code>C:\\dev\</code>."
</p>

<p>
As monstrous and scary as this may sound, this worked.  But it worked for a few
reasons that may make it seem untenable today: this was it.  There was no other
source to deal with.  If it wasn't in our <a href="https://www.nongnu.org/cvs/">CVS</a> tree, there really wasn't any
concern for it at the time.  Outside dependencies didn't really exist.  Aside
from the tooling and libraries of Microsoft, there wasn't much in the realm of
outside dependencies.  Something I find typical of certain enterprise
structures: there is inherent risk associated with and aversion to anything not
controlled by the capital of the enterprise itself.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I'm confident things have changed since my time there.  <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/">Mercurial</a> is being used
instead of <a href="https://www.nongnu.org/cvs/">CVS</a>, for example!
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
From this, I used the single tree construct as a foundation of organizing
projects.
</p>
</div>

<h3 id="org6a8573b"><a id="ID-58b4926d-5392-49c5-89b4-f0592215cd65"></a>Eclipse</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6a8573b">
<p>
Starting university, our first tool was <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>.  Being relatively spoiled by
<a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/">Visual Studio</a>, <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> seemed archaic.  But something that stuck out is the
question it asked every time it started that never occurred to me before:
"Select the directory as a workspace".  A very initial hint towards an overall
(meta) structure of projects.
</p>

<p>
Since I was using <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> for essentially all of my school projects, I would
always have a <code>~/workspace</code> directory, as a more natural location to place
source, I eventually started placing more programming projects under this
directory structure, even if the projects were not necessarily <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/">Java</a>/<a href="https://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>
projects.
</p>

<p>
Here, I began using the <code>~/workspace</code> folder as the foundation for all
organization after this.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5d67deb" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5d67deb"><a id="ID-b74a2024-ab5f-43ef-b24e-e252176d69e2"></a>Maven</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5d67deb">
<p>
As typical for editor envy, the desire to ditch <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> for <a href="https://www.vim.org\">Vim</a> became more and
more apparent, finding appropriate tooling for managing projects quickly became
a necessity.
</p>

<p>
Since I was mainly developing <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/">Java</a> projects, <a href="https://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> was an obvious contender.
While, at the time I didn't really enjoy the opinionated approach of <a href="https://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>, the
"correct" domain name ordering stuck out as an interesting idea for organizing
packages in <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/">Java</a>.  That is, <a href="https://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>, by default, creates a package structure
similar to the following <code>com.example.projectx</code>, which translates to a folder
structure of <code>src/main/java/com/example/projectx</code>.
</p>

<p>
While I didn't end up using <a href="https://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> for a little while longer, I did eventually
borrow a modified version of the domain name folder structure.  For example, I
would use <code>com.example</code> as a root folder for all <code>example.com</code> projects.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgaf4da39" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgaf4da39"><a id="ID-98454288-3c83-4641-a93b-624d76ea277f"></a>Golang</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgaf4da39">
<p>
Prior to 1.12 and Go modules, <a href="https://golang.org/">Golang</a> imposed its own project structuring.  I
have had conflicting thoughts about this.  On one hand, the imposed homogeneity
of projects and meta-structure was serene since it was always so easy to find
references and dependencies.  On the other hand, it disrupted my current
organization methods.  Furthermore, since I had effectively two different
working trees of source code, I had more mental burden when considering
ownership issues with respect to client or employer code.  With <a href="https://golang.org/">Golang</a>
projects, it was no longer possible to ensure all source belonging to a
particular organization was under a single tree.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, related to the homogeneous folder structures was the encoding of the
source repository in the dependency or code base, e.g., projects from <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> were
found in the folder path <code>${GOPATH}/src/github.com/</code>.
</p>

<p>
Now that <a href="https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules">Go Modules</a> are the default and the <code>${GOPATH}</code> isn't really used too
much, I did still borrow some of the naming and organization constructs from
<a href="https://golang.org/">Golang</a>.  Chiefly, I now used <code>~/workspace/src</code> as the root of all of the projects
instead of simply <code>~/workspace</code>.  Furthermore, while I'm not particularly
interested in the platform the source is hosted on (more on this later), I <span class="underline">am</span>
interested in the owning or overarching organization behind the code.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8f7a482" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org8f7a482"><a id="ID-f638a40b-7e43-4c8b-a5ee-6bdece7fbc2a"></a>Personal Projects, Professional Development, and Contracting</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8f7a482">
<p>
As a developer, hobbyist or professional, there is a need to have a clear
delineation between projects.  This comes both for personal desires to be
organized, but also arises because of contractual reasons; I would rather my
own work not be reassigned to a company just because of being hired (which <span class="underline">is</span>
what most developer employee contracts argue, though, obligatory "INAL").
Therefore, I need a clear mechanism for delineating ownership.  Thankfully,
this can be baked into the folder structure itself with relative ease!
</p>

<p>
I mostly stumbled into this since I had started using a personal computer for
one internship and again later when hired full-time, and later when
contracting.  I have tried a few different techniques to sort out the issues of
entangling source from different organizations.
</p>

<p>
The first I tried was having a separate user account on the machine for work
and personal and this worked well enough but was a pain point for most
everything else.  Namely, my <a href="https://github.com/kennyballou/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> game wasn't where it is today, there was
a lot of replicated files between the two user accounts.  Furthermore, this
model does not scale as the number of "engagements" increases.
</p>

<p>
Another approach I had considered but never tried was using something like
<a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/">QubesOS</a> since its virtual machine and isolation would functionally achieve
separation very easily.  However, I was worried about how I would accomplish
backups if necessary.  Furthermore, I was really happy with then <a href="https://www.archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a> and
later <a href="https://gentoo.org">Gentoo</a>.  However, this approach likely would scale better than using
separate accounts, and in some circumstances may be the only (legally) safe way
to achieve separation.

<p>
As noted, I'm not particularly interested in the hosting platform or forge of a
code base or project.  The source repository may be moved, or there may even be
several different "repositories" that host the code; this is made possible and
evident because <a href="https://git-scm.com">Git's</a> <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2018/07/23/Git-is-already-distributed.html">distributed</a> nature: there typically <i>just</i> happens to be a
single, "blessed" remote repository that most work is started from, but by
virtue of distribution, <a href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a> does not necessitate nor require a single "remote".
Therefore, I prefer to use the owning organization/entity domain name as the
root of organizing ownership.  This could be the <code>groupId</code> in <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/">Java</a> projects, this
could be the parent organization or foundation in the cases of projects under
<a href="https://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> or <a href="https://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a>, this could be the personal domain of the maintainer, <i>etc</i>.
</p>

<p>
That said, not every project I clone into my workspace seems to require the
same attention to detail.  Therefore, there might be a settling period where
<a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> projects are cloned into the <code>com/github/${user}/${repo}</code> structure before
being moved to a more permanent home, if at all.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a> itself is better suited and can better handle the tracking of the various
remote repositories for a project.  The filesystem and organization method, on
the other hand, are not well suited to the complexities of remote repository
management (nor should they be).  That is, if I "fork" a project on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, I
can add my own remote repository and the upstream source repository into the
same cloned version of the project.

While the historical context may not be complete enough to allow someone to
perfectly derive my own organization, I do hope it serves as a solid foundation
for <span class="underline">why</span> the organization is the way it is.

<p>
In my home folder, I have a single directory, <code>workspace</code>.  Under this directory,
there is <code>src</code>.  Having <code>src</code> further allows for the addition of <code>docs</code> or <code>pkgs</code>, but
I'm not currently using this.  Finally under <code>src</code> there is the top-level
domains of all the projects I have, e.g., <code>com</code>, <code>org</code>, <code>io</code>, <code>net</code>, <i>etc</i>.  Under each
TLD, is the next domain part, e.g., <code>io/devnulllabs</code>, <code>com/github</code>, <code>org/kernel</code>.
Under each of these parent structures is the actual project folders.

Now that it's all written, I'm not sure this discussion truly warranted its own
post.  I've wanted to read something like this from others before, but in
seeing what it boils down to, I certainly see why no one talks about it.
</p>

<p>
It's fairly easy to describe the current state of things, it's fairly easy to
demonstrate what it looks like, but it's immensely difficult to distill the
motivation and influences that over 12 years bring us to today.
