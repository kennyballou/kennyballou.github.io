communicative commit messages.  These same posts, however, tend to otherwise
ignore the question of granularity.  In this post, I attempt an answer to
granularity.  The answer is, of course, it depends.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1655c85">
<p>
Regardless of position on "good" or "communicative," we are often left with
questions about the commits themselves.  How frequent should we commit?  What
should be included in the commit?  What should be <i>excluded</i> from the commit?
What should the operational state of the entire code base be at each commit?
</p>

<p>
What we're asking about is the granularity of commits.  How many commits
constitutes a story, a feature, or a bug.  There are two schools of thought on
the question, although I'm not sure it's been so explicit.  On one side, the
discretization of work leads naturally into a series of commits.  Another, the
task is singular, therefore, there should be only one commit that lands in
<code>master</code>, seldom more than one.
</p>

<p>
While both of these answers have tradeoffs, what you, as a developer do,
depends entirely on your team.  Similar to good commit messages, if your team
has a policy of a single commit per task/story/feature/bug/whatever,
pragmatically, stick with it.  Understand why the team arrived at that answer
before suggesting the other approach.  Vice-versa, if the team wants the
discrete chunks of work to be committed and then a series of commits together
combine into the completion of a task, go with it.  However, if your team
doesn't have a consistent choice, <i>that</i> is what should be fixed.
</p>

<h2 id="org074967c"><a id="ID-ca580080-825e-47e1-a481-51aeb317151c"></a>Single Story -&gt; Single Commit</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org074967c">
<p>
Using a single commit for tasks comes with a lot of simplicity, but the commits
themselves will be large.  Integrating the single commit is relatively
simple.  Resolving merge conflicts is simpler since only the end state has to
be considered.  Reviewers only have to test the operational build state of the
single commit when reviewing or merging.  Comprehending the change and its
rationale includes reading a single commit message.  Ultimately, single commits
are associated with simplicity.
</p>

<p>
However, the commit itself, the changes contained in the commit will, on
average, be substantial and far reaching.  It may be difficult for reviewers to
separate the signal from the noise.  If there is an issue with the commit, a
bisection indicates the single commit is the cause of a bug, and to rapidly
resolve the issue, a revert is issued, the whole commit goes, including any
possible refactorings that improved the system.  Worse, these refactorings may
be referenced down the line, causing more issues.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Arguments can be made that "refactoring" constitutes its own task, and
therefore is in its own commit.  Unfortunately, this is not always the case.
The history of code is far messier than even I wish to admit.

<h2 id="orgc4741c1"><a id="ID-ebba1bce-544b-4ea5-80a0-57bbb17b8335"></a>Discrete Tasks -&gt; Multiple Atomic Commits</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc4741c1">
<p>
Instead of using a single commit which contains every single change that was
made to accomplish the task, we can use a single commit for each of those
tasks.  This dampens the size of each commit, but incurs a little complexity
for the reviewing and comprehending phases of development.  Stringent adherence
to atomic commits allows for <a href="https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-blame">git blame</a> to provide better contextual information
when attempting to understand any one specific line of code.  Comparatively, it
is easy for changes made using a single commit to become lost in the noise and
lose context.
</p>

<p>
Using atomic commits, however, can make integration tasks particularly
difficult when using <a href="https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase">rebase</a>.  For example, a series of atomic commits are made
on a topic branch and are ready for merging into <code>master</code>.  During the
development of this topic branch, other changes were made and merged before
this topic branch lands.  Easy, <a href="https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-fetch">fetch</a> <code>origin/master</code>, <a href="https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-merge">merge</a> <code>origin/master</code> into
<code>master</code>, and <a href="https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase">rebase</a> the topic branch onto <code>master</code>.  Fate would have it, though,
there are conflicts.  Worse, the conflict is in one of the first commits, and
the changes need to be propagated through the commits appropriately for the
series to remain sensible.  This is not easy.  Aside from enabling <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rerere">rerere</a> and
using <code>diff3</code> for <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/merge-config"><code>merge.conflictstyle</code></a>, I am personally unaware of a repeatable,
universal way to achieve reliable results when rebasing with conflicts.
</p>

<p>
The difficulty is that each commit must remain atomic and make the changes it
states.  However, in the middle of the rebase, it is difficult to remember what
the change should be for the specified commit.  We easily remember the end
result, but using the end result may create empty commits or worse, more
conflicts.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
If you, dear reader, are aware of a better approach, please share.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Atomic commits afford more granularity in case a change needs to be reverted.
Although, finding that one commit may be more difficult since there are
generally more commits to bisect.  Which leads into the next issue, each atomic
commit <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119">MUST</a> be stable and in working order, e.g., the project is buildable
without error, tests SHALL pass, etc.  Ensuring this is similarly not easy.
</p>

<p>
While using a series of commits to communicate a single story can be complex.
It does afford other flexibilities not possible when using the former approach.
Specifically, pull requests consisting of multiple commits can be partially
accepted.  <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and other source forges do not have tooling for this in their
web UI's, but this is certainly possible and <span class="underline">is</span> done in larger projects, e.g.,
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/">Linux</a>.

<p>
Let's examine some pull requests which demonstrate both approaches.  I'm going
to point to pull requests I have submitted since I don't want to cast any
unintentional judgment to someone else.  They are both for the same project and
they are essentially the same set of changes.  The <a href="https://github.com/mpdel/libmpdel/pull/2">first</a> has one all of the
changes into a single commit.  It tells a larger story about enabling usage of
UNIX Sockets for a local connection.  There are several discrete changes
required to get there, but the it's all for the larger goal of connecting to a
local machine's <a href="https://www.musicpd.org/">muisc player daemon</a> via the AF<sub>UNIX</sub> connection type.

libmpdel: enable use of local UNIX sockets for MPD

By using `make-network-process` we can tune the parameters for either
network connections or local UNIX socket connections.

As an added bonus, connections are very fast.  In my limited testing,
`make-network-process` tends to be dramatically faster than the
`open-network-stream` function.  Of course, without passing `:family
'ipv4` to `make-network-process`, the two functions exhibit similar
performance, so it's not as simple as "one is written in C and the other
is written in ELisp."

Deprecate/obsolete the `libmpdel-port` variable in favor of
`libmpdel-service` which semantically makes more sense now that libmpdel
can connect to either a port or a socket.

`libmpdel-profiles` also work with the new local socket connection
behaviour.

Although I don't use `customize`, the new variable (`libmpdel-service`)
and profiles (`libmpdel-profiles`) should be accessible via `customize`
just the same.

<p>
The <a href="https://github.com/mpdel/libmpdel/pull/3">second</a> pull request is only slightly different from the first because there
were changes in the upstream <code>master</code> branch that does some of the leg work that
the first commit proposed.  However, at the discretion of the project owner and
maintainer, the first large commit was broken down into its component commits.
Each commit tells the story of its own change, culminating into the final
commit closing the larger story of enabling the UNIX socket connection type.

Clearly, each of the previous four commits are smaller and more focused than
the single, all encompassing commit.  Each commit provides focused commentary
to the specific lines being changed.  While it's missing in this case, since
this is more a personal issue than a product with board of story cards, or what
have you, it's easy to add story context to the bottom of the commit message so
that others reading this can see more explicit motivation for the smaller
commit.

It's rather easy to argue for "small, atomic" commits, but I sense we have
failed to clearly articulate what we mean by "small".  How small is "small"?
What are the contours of our definition of "small"?  As a result, we have
converged to one of two camps, where we say a single story is "small", or the
individual, discretized changes are "small".
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The third and/or fourth camp that exists, which is out of scope of this entire
discussion, are commits which follow the messy history of <span class="underline">how</span> everything came
together.  Every commit is not buildable, tested, etc., but merely a step in
the direction toward the completion of some task.  The first draft, if you
will, towards the completion of a task.  In previous discussions, I've referred
to this style has the how the changes "actually" came into existence.  Whereas,
here, we are talking about commits which are edited to tell the story of the
changes, how the changes <i>ought</i> to have happened, if we were perfect and knew
everything.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I'm not going to argue either way which strategy is better.  As mentioned
before, this is a team and/or personal choice.  It's a protocol about
communicating changes in software that needs to be decided to effectively
collaborate.  However, I hope I have provided sufficient informational context
for you and your team to make a decision about which strategy to pursue.
