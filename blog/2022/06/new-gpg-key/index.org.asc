#+BEGIN_PREVIEW
Once again, it is time to announce a new GPG key.  This document is signed with
the old and new key to establish authenticity.  However, I forgot the password
for the master key, so I cannot certify the new key with the old key.  Please
use the new key.

This document is signed using the following command:

#+begin_src bash
gpg --clearsign --armor --sign-with B0CAA28A02958308 --sign-with 82D94B35744E1B34 index.org
#+end_src

Download the public key with the following command:

#+begin_src bash
curl -fSL https://kennyballou.com/B74CC4B41148C3DB364BC21182D94B35744E1B34.asc -O
gpg --import B74CC4B41148C3DB364BC21182D94B35744E1B34.asc
#+end_src

Verify the fingerprint of the new key:

#+begin_src bash
gpg --fingerprint B74CC4B41148C3DB364BC21182D94B35744E1B34

** Differences from Old Setup
:PROPERTIES:

:END:

Instead of using RSA keys, I have switched to using Elliptic Curve (ed25519)
keys which should have around the same strength of RSA 4096 keys.  Furthermore,
the benefit of this is that the subkeys all have the same strength, which
previously was not an option with RSA keys.

The expiration of the master key is a little longer than the previous keys, 8
years instead of 5 years.  Ideally, this means another key transition post
won't appear for 8 years.  If I remember the password, and cryptography doesn't
change significantly, I can also extend the expiration of the key as well.
