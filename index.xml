    Notebooks represent an important improvement for interactive and iterative
    research.  However, they tend to lack portability, reproducibility, and
    repeatability.  In this post, I want to explore the iterations of using <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org
    mode</a> notebooks combined with other tools to develop a (hopefully) portable,
    reproducible, and repeatable notebook for software engineering experiments.
    While the focus remains narrowed to software engineering, the tools and
    techniques described should be applicable to any study requiring these
    properties.

    <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org-Mode</a> is a great way to store <code>TODO</code> items, store notes, and keep track of
    projects.  However, possibly due to ignorance of what is available, getting a
    concrete high-level view of a project is difficult.  There are numerous
    different visualizations that can be created to see the state of a project.
    Each answers a specific question, none are entirely complete.  Today, I have
    worked out a mechanism to generate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart">Gantt Charts</a> using <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Dynamic-Blocks.html">dynamic blocks</a> for a
    specific project tree.  In followup posts, I may work out some other

    Debugging <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/">Java</a> programs in <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> has been a goal and overall feature I have
    wanted for some time.  However, every time I've reached for it, <code>dap-java-debug</code>
    demonstrated an unbearably slow startup.  So much so, that it was often faster
    and more productive to launch <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</a>, fight <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a> and <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</a> to load the
    project correctly, and launch the debugger from <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    No more.  The pain is gone, forced on by fighting <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</a> to load one too many
    times.

    For a few years, I've been using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> for blog generation.  Recently,
    I've decided I wanted to take static site generation into a different
    direction.  Specifically, I wanted to use a different source markup and I
    wanted to write my own tool set for generating the actual HTML.

    Configuring <a href="https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky"><code>conky</code></a> to display a count and symbol of new mail turned out to be
    more tricky than I had originally anticipated.  This small post quickly

    Previously, in <a href="https://kennyballou.com/blog/2016/01/git-in-reverse">Git in Reverse</a>, we learned about <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and how it internally
    stores information.  Namely, we went over the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5709687/what-are-the-loose-objects-that-the-git-gui-refers-to#5710039">"loose" object</a> format that Git
    uses for storage.  However, in the last post, we did not discuss how Git uses
    another storage format to more compactly store files, changes, and ultimately
    objects.  In this post we will discuss packfiles and how Git uses these
    primarily for using less bandwidth and, only secondarily, using less storage
    space for storing repository contents.

    One of the untold benefits of having a runtime is the ability for that runtime
    to enable loading and unloading code while the runtime is active.  Since the
    runtime is itself, essentially, a virtual machine with its own operating system
    and process scheduling, it has the ability to start and stop, load and unload
    processes and code similar to how "real" operating systems do.

    We all make mistakes.  They are inevitable.  We must accept that we make them
    and move on.  But making mistakes in Git seems to be overly complex to resolve
    and most will simply result to cloning anew and copying the working tree (or
    some subset) and moving on.  This, to me, however, seems like a waste of
    bandwidth as most issues resulting in broken history are in fact quite easy to
    resolve, especially so once the necessary tools are known.

    Developing Elixir/OTP applications is an enlightening, mind-boggling, and
    ultimately enjoyable experience.  There are so many features of the language
    that change the very way we as developers think about concurrency and program
    structure.  From writing pure functional code, to using message passing to
    coordinate complex systems, it is one of the best languages for the SMP
    revolution that has been slowly boiling under our feet.

    It is certainly counter-intuitive to learn to drive by first going backwards,
    so why learn how to use Git in reverse? The short answer is: knowing the
    internals of Git <i>should</i> make the commands and workflows of Git more
    accessible and understandable.
